\section*{Introduction}

This idea for a cipher popped into my head recently.

What follows is a short explanation of the cipher.
Accopanying code is provided for enciphering and deciphering.

\section*{The Cipher}

We are given as plaintext a string of letters A-Z
which will here be represented by numbers 1-26 in
alphabetical order. Let the plaintext be $m$ letters in length,
denoted by $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$,
and the target ciphertext be $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$.

The keys are two permutations $\sigma_0$, $\tau_0$ of
$\{1, 2, \ldots, 26\}$. The keys and the plaintext together produce
sequences of permutations as follows:
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{n+1} &= \sigma_n \circ (a_{2n} \ \ a_{2n+1}) \\
\tau_{n+1} &= \tau_n \circ (a_{2n} \ \ a_{2n+1})
\end{align*}
for all $n$.

\textit{Round brackets are used here to write cycles,
and $\circ$ is used to compose functions.}

And of course we have a way to generate ciphertext from the
plaintext and the sequences of permutations:
\begin{align*}
b_{2n} &= \sigma_n(a_{2n}) \\
b_{2n+1} &= \tau_n (a_{2n+1})
\end{align*}
